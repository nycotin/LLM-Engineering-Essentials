        "\n",
        "* **API-based**: <font color='red'>You use it as it is, with all its lags and downtimes, and there's not much you can do except for using a spare API in case of trouble.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Self-served**: <font color='green'>With the right LLMOps skills, you can optimize your inference and, in particular, make the your query cost much lower than in API-based scenario. Moreover, there are inference engines that may be of help.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "  <font color='red'>But unless you're good at LLMOps, it might be difficult for you to actually make it cheaper and more reliable than with API providers. That's especially true if the size of your LLM or its planned workload requires for multi-GPU deployment.</font>\n",

        "### Capability\n",

        "\n",
        "### Customization potential\n",
        "\n",
        "* **API-based**: <font color='black'>Some API providers suggest fine tuning as a service.</font>\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Data security\n",
        "\n",
        "* **API-based**: <font color='red'>You can't just send you customers' data or your internal code into someone's API. See [this case](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-chatgpt-and-other-chatbots-for-employees-after-sensitive-code-leak/), for example.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Self-served**: <font color='green'>You don't surrender your own and your customers' data to third-party API providers.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "### Price scaling\n",
        "\n",
        "* **API-based**: APIs are paid based on the number of token processed. If you don't have many requests, it may be easier to use APIs and avoid having engineer deployment team.\n",

        "* **Self-served**: With open-source LLMs, you pay for compute that you use, plus the hidden cost of deployment (including the salary of the engineers that do it). In most cases, GPU hours make most of the cost. But as soon as you have enough requests per hour, using a self-served LLM may become cheaper than using a proprietary API.\n",

        "### Takeaways\n",

        "Choosing between self-served and API-based LLMs is not an easy thing; however, a general rule is to start prototyping with an API and only move to a self-served option if this is fustified in both cost and efforts. Later in this course we'll discuss how to make rought price comparison for making this choice."

Though by default LLM parameters are stored in 32 bit floating point precision, they are mostly used in 16 bit (without much loss in downstream quality). But they can be further compressed to 8 bit float, 8 bit integer, 4 bit float; there are even more radical approaches, like \"1.5 bit quantization\" (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17764), for example). Of course, quantized models perform worse than the original ones, so there's a trade off between quality and cost. We'll further discuss quantization later in this course.\n",

This strategy is called **self-consistency**. We'll discuss it and other orchestration approaches further in Topic 2, in the [inference-time compute](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/blob/main/topic2/r.2_inference_time_compute.ipynb) notebook.\n",

LLMs are already good enough to automate routine tasks in software engineering, and we're expecting even more in the nearest future.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Most LLMs are trained for chatting with the user, and this makes them quite good at *continuing* a discussion. But in coding, we don't usually just add something to the end of the existing code. Instead, we're **filling in the middle**. Even when just suggesting autocomplete, it's good to be aware of code above and below. For a long prompt that may contain several source files, a chat LLM is likely to corrupt the existing code while filling in the middle.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Thus, a practical advice for coding with a chat LLM: if you need to add something amidst the existing code, ask the LLM to generate new code snippets, and only after that ask the LLM to assemble the old and the new code together.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Specialized coding LLMs are more attuned to coding tasks, and they struggle less with the fill-in-the-middle task.\n",

Moreover, we've discussed that even better capability is **non-linear** reasoning - when a model is able to explore several ideas and criticize itself before outputting the final solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, an LLM needs good reasoning abilities to produce good results, and this has tight connection to logic, math, and coding skills. In the same family, larger models tend to be better at reasoning (as at everything else) that the smaller ones. However, it's not so easy to compare them across families. A smaller model trained on high-quality, carefully curated data can outshine a larger one trained on more general web corpora.\n",
        "\n",

        "* OpenAI's **o1** and **o1-mini** were among the first LLMs with this capability; **o3** that appeared later did a major and a totally unexpected breakthrough at a number of important benchmarks such as [FrontierMath](https://epoch.ai/frontiermath) and [ARC-AGI](https://arcprize.org/). Theit most significant drawback though is their price which is somewhat forbidding. The smaller **o4-mini** model somewhat relieves this restriction.\n",
        "* An open-source **DeepSeek R1** appeared in end January 2025 and created a huge fuss (and a stock market selloff) with its top-tier capability, dumping API prices, and allegedly cheap training. Despite some controversy around its comparison with other top-tier models, R1 is really good and quite promising.\n",
        "* **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** was among the first LLMs which allow you to control the reasoning length. Given that long reasoning traces make things much more expensive (and output tokens are usually ~3x more expensive than input tokens), this is very handy. Among open-source models, **Qwen3** series also share this ability.\n",
        "* **Gemini 2.5** also has excellent reasoning capabilites. Together with the fact that it's obviously trained on many PhD-level math books, this makes it a good math assistant.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep in mind though that LLMs trained to perform reasoning will do this even when it's not actually needed. We'll illustrate this with a task of finding a path on a map with forbidden regions and three LLMs: **Llama-3.1-405B**, **DeepSeek R1**, and **o3-mini**.\n",

Make sure that you only measure the timing of producing the competion, not of the whole `evaluate_single_question` running - this will be especially relevant when we add the translation phase.\n",

        "  In theory, average latency would reflect the LLM's size and average answer length. Note that for rarer languages tokens will be smaller, and as consequence the answer length in tokens will be larger (even if visible answer length will be comparable with English). This will, of course, contribute to the latency.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  In reality though, average latency also highly depends on the *API provider* or your own deployment efforts. APIs may have periods of higher or lower latency; they also introduce optimizations which might work or not work, depending on the architectural details of different LLMs.\n",

When it's `None`, the LLM will be tested on the original English questions and answers; otherwise, the specified language will be used. If you have time, try several MMLU topics and several languages. How much will the quality fall in comparison with English?\n",

If you have access to OpenAI or Anthropic API, leveraging their models won't hurt. If you use long-reasoning models such as `o4`, `DeepSeek R1`, or `Qwen3`, don't forget to increase the `max_tokens` parameter for the translator call, because these models tend to be wordy.\n",
        "  * Assess the translation quality before you start running your benchmarks. For that, choose the language you or your friends know well.\n",

The first one might be tricky, because you'll need the LLM to strictly obey the format and abstain from commenting on the answers or a potential solution. It can be achieved through clever prompting, but the better strategy is using either few-shot examples or structured generation which will be the discussed in Topic 2. So, for now, we suggest separate translation."
